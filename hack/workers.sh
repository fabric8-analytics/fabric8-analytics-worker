#   WORKER_ADMINISTRATION_REGION - (required) worker namespace to operate on
#
# Note:
#   * WORKER_INCLUDE_QUEUES is disjoint with WORKER_EXCLUDE_QUEUES and vice versa
#   * if WORKER_EXCLUDE_QUEUES and WORKER_INCLUDE_QUEUES are not present worker will listen on all queues
#   * WORKER_EXCLUDE_QUEUES excludes queues based on list of all queues that are present according to YAML conf files
