  # This flow is used in liveness probes and the flow actually does nothing. With this we just ensure that we are able
  # to connect to the broker and publish messages there. If no broker listens on this queue, it is also OK since old
  # messages get automatically deleted, iff the broker is not configured to persist messages forever.
