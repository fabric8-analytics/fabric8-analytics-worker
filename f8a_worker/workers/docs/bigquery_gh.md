BigQuery_GH worker
------------------

This worker can crawl through all `package.json` files located in top-level directories in all public GitHub repositories and extract a list of dependencies from them. It does so by querying BigQuery's public GitHub dataset (`[bigquery-public-data:github_repos]`). Since BigQuery charges for querying data, the worker stores all results in our PostgreSQL database.

Note this worker requires a JSON key for access to the BigQuery service, see the [configuration section](#configuration) for details.

Known limitations:
- only NPM is supported
- worker treats forked repositories equally to original ones
- worker ignores version of dependencies


#### Configuration

This worker is meant to be run periodically and the interval is configurable, see default jobs in Jobs service.

By default, the worker looks for the JSON key required for communication with the BigQuery service in `/var/lib/secrets/bigquery.json`. You can either put your key there, or you can override the location via `BIGQUERY_JSON_KEY` environment variable.
You can generate the key in the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) (authentication required).
