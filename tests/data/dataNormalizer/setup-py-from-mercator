(requires PySocks; $ pip install requests[socks])\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.15.1.\n\n2.9.2 (04-29-2016)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Improvements**\n\n- Change built-in CaseInsensitiveDict (used for headers) to use OrderedDict\n  as its underlying datastore.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Don't use redirect_cache if allow_redirects=False\n- When passed objects that throw exceptions from ``tell()``, send them via\n  chunked transfer encoding instead of failing.\n- Raise a ProxyError for proxy related connection issues.\n\n2.9.1 (2015-12-21)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Resolve regression introduced in 2.9.0 that made it impossible to send binary\n  strings as bodies in Python 3.\n- Fixed errors when calculating cookie expiration dates in certain locales.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.13.1.\n\n2.9.0 (2015-12-15)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Minor Improvements** (Backwards compatible)\n\n- The ``verify`` keyword argument now supports being passed a path to a\n  directory of CA certificates, not just a single-file bundle.\n- Warnings are now emitted when sending files opened in text mode.\n- Added the 511 Network Authentication Required status code to the status code\n  registry.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- For file-like objects that are not seeked to the very beginning, we now\n  send the content length for the number of bytes we will actually read, rather\n  than the total size of the file, allowing partial file uploads.\n- When uploading file-like objects, if they are empty or have no obvious\n  content length we set ``Transfer-Encoding: chunked`` rather than\n  ``Content-Length: 0``.\n- We correctly receive the response in buffered mode when uploading chunked\n  bodies.\n- We now handle being passed a query string as a bytestring on Python 3, by\n  decoding it as UTF-8.\n- Sessions are now closed in all cases (exceptional and not) when using the\n  functional API rather than leaking and waiting for the garbage collector to\n  clean them up.\n- Correctly handle digest auth headers with a malformed ``qop`` directive that\n  contains no token, by treating it the same as if no ``qop`` directive was\n  provided at all.\n- Minor performance improvements when removing specific cookies by name.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n- Updated urllib3 to 1.13.\n\n2.8.1 (2015-10-13)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Update certificate bundle to match ``certifi`` 2015.9.6.2's weak certificate\n  bundle.\n- Fix a bug in 2.8.0 where requests would raise ``ConnectTimeout`` instead of\n  ``ConnectionError``\n- When using the PreparedRequest flow, requests will now correctly respect the\n  ``json`` parameter. Broken in 2.8.0.\n- When using the PreparedRequest flow, requests will now correctly handle a\n  Unicode-string method name on Python 2. Broken in 2.8.0.\n\n2.8.0 (2015-10-05)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Minor Improvements** (Backwards Compatible)\n\n- Requests now supports per-host proxies. This allows the ``proxies``\n  dictionary to have entries of the form\n  ``{'\u003cscheme\u003e://\u003chostname\u003e': '\u003cproxy\u003e'}``. Host-specific proxies will be used\n  in preference to the previously-supported scheme-specific ones, but the\n  previous syntax will continue to work.\n- ``Response.raise_for_status`` now prints the URL that failed as part of the\n  exception message.\n- ``requests.utils.get_netrc_auth`` now takes an ``raise_errors`` kwarg,\n  defaulting to ``False``. When ``True``, errors parsing ``.netrc`` files cause\n  exceptions to be thrown.\n- Change to bundled projects import logic to make it easier to unbundle\n  requests downstream.\n- Changed the default User-Agent string to avoid leaking data on Linux: now\n  contains only the requests version.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- The ``json`` parameter to ``post()`` and friends will now only be used if\n  neither ``data`` nor ``files`` are present, consistent with the\n  documentation.\n- We now ignore empty fields in the ``NO_PROXY`` environment variable.\n- Fixed problem where ``httplib.BadStatusLine`` would get raised if combining\n  ``stream=True`` with ``contextlib.closing``.\n- Prevented bugs where we would attempt to return the same connection back to\n  the connection pool twice when sending a Chunked body.\n- Miscellaneous minor internal changes.\n- Digest Auth support is now thread safe.\n\n**Updates**\n\n- Updated urllib3 to 1.12.\n\n2.7.0 (2015-05-03)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\nThis is the first release that follows our new release process. For more, see\n`our documentation\n\u003chttp://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/community/release-process/\u003e`_.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Updated urllib3 to 1.10.4, resolving several bugs involving chunked transfer\n  encoding and response framing.\n\n2.6.2 (2015-04-23)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fix regression where compressed data that was sent as chunked data was not\n  properly decompressed. (#2561)\n\n2.6.1 (2015-04-22)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Remove VendorAlias import machinery introduced in v2.5.2.\n\n- Simplify the PreparedRequest.prepare API: We no longer require the user to\n  pass an empty list to the hooks keyword argument. (c.f. #2552)\n\n- Resolve redirects now receives and forwards all of the original arguments to\n  the adapter. (#2503)\n\n- Handle UnicodeDecodeErrors when trying to deal with a unicode URL that\n  cannot be encoded in ASCII. (#2540)\n\n- Populate the parsed path of the URI field when performing Digest\n  Authentication. (#2426)\n\n- Copy a PreparedRequest's CookieJar more reliably when it is not an instance\n  of RequestsCookieJar. (#2527)\n\n2.6.0 (2015-03-14)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- CVE-2015-2296: Fix handling of cookies on redirect. Previously a cookie\n  without a host value set would use the hostname for the redirected URL\n  exposing requests users to session fixation attacks and potentially cookie\n  stealing. This was disclosed privately by Matthew Daley of\n  `BugFuzz \u003chttps://bugfuzz.com\u003e`_. This affects all versions of requests from\n  v2.1.0 to v2.5.3 (inclusive on both ends).\n\n- Fix error when requests is an ``install_requires`` dependency and ``python\n  setup.py test`` is run. (#2462)\n\n- Fix error when urllib3 is unbundled and requests continues to use the\n  vendored import location.\n\n- Include fixes to ``urllib3``'s header handling.\n\n- Requests' handling of unvendored dependencies is now more restrictive.\n\n**Features and Improvements**\n\n- Support bytearrays when passed as parameters in the ``files`` argument.\n  (#2468)\n\n- Avoid data duplication when creating a request with ``str``, ``bytes``, or\n  ``bytearray`` input to the ``files`` argument.\n\n2.5.3 (2015-02-24)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Revert changes to our vendored certificate bundle. For more context see\n  (#2455, #2456, and http://bugs.python.org/issue23476)\n\n2.5.2 (2015-02-23)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Features and Improvements**\n\n- Add sha256 fingerprint support. (`shazow/urllib3#540`_)\n\n- Improve the performance of headers. (`shazow/urllib3#544`_)\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Copy pip's import machinery. When downstream redistributors remove\n  requests.packages.urllib3 the import machinery will continue to let those\n  same symbols work. Example usage in requests' documentation and 3rd-party\n  libraries relying on the vendored copies of urllib3 will work without having\n  to fallback to the system urllib3.\n\n- Attempt to quote parts of the URL on redirect if unquoting and then quoting\n  fails. (#2356)\n\n- Fix filename type check for multipart form-data uploads. (#2411)\n\n- Properly handle the case where a server issuing digest authentication\n  challenges provides both auth and auth-int qop-values. (#2408)\n\n- Fix a socket leak. (`shazow/urllib3#549`_)\n\n- Fix multiple ``Set-Cookie`` headers properly. (`shazow/urllib3#534`_)\n\n- Disable the built-in hostname verification. (`shazow/urllib3#526`_)\n\n- Fix the behaviour of decoding an exhausted stream. (`shazow/urllib3#535`_)\n\n**Security**\n\n- Pulled in an updated ``cacert.pem``.\n\n- Drop RC4 from the default cipher list.

Raised instead of ``urllib3``\n  ``DecodeError`` exceptions.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Avoid many many exceptions from the buggy implementation of ``proxy_bypass`` on OS X in Python 2.6.\n- Avoid crashing when attempting to get authentication credentials from ~/.netrc when running as a user without a home directory.\n- Use the correct pool size for pools of connections to proxies.\n- Fix iteration of ``CookieJar`` objects.\n- Ensure that cookies are persisted over redirect.\n- Switch back to using chardet, since it has merged with charade.\n\n2.1.0 (2013-12-05)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Updated CA Bundle, of course.\n- Cookies set on individual Requests through a ``Session`` (e.g. via ``Session.get()``) are no longer persisted to the ``Session``.\n- Clean up connections when we hit problems during chunked upload, rather than leaking them.\n- Return connections to the pool when a chunked upload is successful, rather than leaking it.\n- Match the HTTPbis recommendation for HTTP 301 redirects.\n- Prevent hanging when using streaming uploads and Digest Auth when a 401 is received.\n- Values of headers set by Requests are now always the native string type.\n- Fix previously broken SNI support.\n- Fix accessing HTTP proxies using proxy authentication.\n- Unencode HTTP Basic usernames and passwords extracted from URLs.\n- Support for IP address ranges for no_proxy environment variable\n- Parse headers correctly when users override the default ``Host:`` header.\n- Avoid munging the URL in case of case-sensitive servers.\n- Looser URL handling for non-HTTP/HTTPS urls.\n- Accept unicode methods in Python 2.6 and 2.7.\n- More resilient cookie handling.\n- Make ``Response`` objects pickleable.\n- Actually added MD5-sess to Digest Auth instead of pretending to like last time.\n- Updated internal urllib3.\n- Fixed @Lukasa's lack of taste.\n\n2.0.1 (2013-10-24)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Updated included CA Bundle with new mistrusts and automated process for the future\n- Added MD5-sess to Digest Auth\n- Accept per-file headers in multipart file POST messages.\n- Fixed: Don't send the full URL on CONNECT messages.\n- Fixed: Correctly lowercase a redirect scheme.\n- Fixed: Cookies not persisted when set via functional API.\n- Fixed: Translate urllib3 ProxyError into a requests ProxyError derived from ConnectionError.\n- Updated internal urllib3 and chardet.\n\n2.0.0 (2013-09-24)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**API Changes:**\n\n- Keys in the Headers dictionary are now native strings on all Python versions,\n  i.e. bytestrings on Python 2, unicode on Python 3.\n- Proxy URLs now *must* have an explicit scheme. A ``MissingSchema`` exception\n  will be raised if they don't.\n- Timeouts now apply to read time if ``Stream=False``.\n- ``RequestException`` is now a subclass of ``IOError``, not ``RuntimeError``.\n- Added new method to ``PreparedRequest`` objects: ``PreparedRequest.copy()``.\n- Added new method to ``Session`` objects: ``Session.update_request()``. This\n  method updates a ``Request`` object with the data (e.g. cookies) stored on\n  the ``Session``.\n- Added new method to ``Session`` objects: ``Session.prepare_request()``. This\n  method updates and prepares a ``Request`` object, and returns the\n  corresponding ``PreparedRequest`` object.\n- Added new method to ``HTTPAdapter`` objects: ``HTTPAdapter.proxy_headers()``.\n  This should not be called directly, but improves the subclass interface.\n- ``httplib.IncompleteRead`` exceptions caused by incorrect chunked encoding\n  will now raise a Requests ``ChunkedEncodingError`` instead.\n- Invalid percent-escape sequences now cause a Requests ``InvalidURL``\n  exception to be raised.\n- HTTP 208 no longer uses reason phrase ``\"im_used\"``.
